Where do you keep your private remarks like ideas, personal plans, gift tips, howtos,
dreams, master thesis, research remarks, business vision, finance strategy or auto 
coaching notes? Loads of documents, sketches and remarks spread around the file system, 
web and Post-it notes? Are you able to find then once you create them? Do you know how
they are mutually related when you read or write them? No?

MindForger is **human mind** inspired **knowledge management tool** which
aims to connect the tradition of outline editors with emerging technologies. 
Its mission is to help you in organization of your knowledge and associated 
local, web and real world resources in a way that enables quick navigation, 
concise representation, automatic interconnections, associative completion 
and inferencing.
