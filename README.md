# MindForger Repository

This is an initial repository image of [MindForger](https://github.com/dvorka/mindforger) 
thinking notebook and Markdown IDE.

To open repository with MindForger run the following command from this directory:

```sh
mindforger .
```

The repository is kept separate from MindForger source code to
distinquish changes to the application source code and repository
documents. Such separation enables independent releases and changes to
the application and it's default data.
